	abstract = {Multi-carrier relay selection is of particular interest and challenge due to the spatio-frequency coupling and the dynamics of available spectral and relay resources. Among a number of promising relay selection schemes, combined relay selection stands out as an equilibrium between system complexity and reliability. Recent research progress has witnessed the capability of neural computing as a powerful tool to efﬁciently realize combined relay selection for a given network topology where the number of relays and their locations are ﬁxed and known. However, for contemporary wireless networks that are highly dynamic, the classic neural computing methods can hardly help out because of the scale drifts of input and output matrices. To enable multi-carrier combined relay selection in stochastic wireless networks ({SWNs}) where the number of available relays for selection could vary, we propose a recurrent neural network ({RNN}) based framework and devise several training methods suited for various application scenarios. In addition, we conduct a set of computer experiments to verify the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed {RNN}-based framework compared with several baselines. With the obtained experimental results, we also evaluate and discuss the proposed framework’s reliability, generalization ability, and the robustness against imperfect channel state information ({CSI}).},

	abstract = {Combined relay selection only requires two relays to forward signals transmitted on multiple subcarriers, but the optimal outage performance is almost surely achievable in the high signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) region. However, because combined relay selection involves the generation of the full set of two-relay combinations, the selection complexity of combined relay selection is much higher than that of per-subcarrier relay selection when the number of relays goes large. This drawback restricts the implementation of combined relay selection in dense networks. To overcome this drawback, we propose to enable combined relay selection by supervised machine learning ({ML}). Because the training procedure is off-line, the proposed implementation scheme can considerably reduce the selection complexity and the processing latency. We carry out extensive experiments on {TensorFlow} 2.1 over a graphics processing unit ({GPU}) aided computing cloud server to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The experimental results conﬁrm that supervised {ML} can provide near-optimal performance with lower computing latency that well matches that provided by brute-force search and the optimal relay selection in a per-subcarrier manner.},
